# Interpretable-Credit-Default-Prediction

This repository contains code for the course project on Interpretability, Stability and Model Fairness.

## Project Scope

The project implements comprehensive analysis across three key dimensions:

1. Global Interpretability: Surrogate models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees), Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)
2. Local Interpretability: LIME, ICE, SHAP methods
3. Performance Interpretability: Permutation Importance
4. Structural Stability: Model performance evaluation across train/validation/test splits
5. Model Fairness: Fairness assessment with respect to protected attributes, Fair Partial Dependence Plots (FPDP)

## Models

1. Black-box model: CatBoost
2. Surrogate models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor
